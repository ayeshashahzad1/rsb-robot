# Solution Design for tasks.py

## Overview

The tasks.py script is designed to automate the process of sales data processing, encompassing tasks such as website navigation, login, Excel file download, form filling, result collection, PDF export, and logout.

## Architecture

The script is structured to execute the following operations in sequence:

### 1. Website Navigation

This operation directs the browser to the URL specified in the .env file.

### 2. Authentication

This operation populates the login form with credentials from the .env file and submits the form.

### 3. Data Acquisition

This operation retrieves an Excel file containing sales data from a predefined URL.

### 4. Form Population

This operation reads data from the downloaded Excel file and populates a sales form accordingly.

### 5. Result Capture

This operation captures a screenshot of the page to record the results.

### 6. Report Generation

This operation converts the collected results into a PDF format for reporting purposes.

### 7. Session Termination

This operation terminates the session by clicking the 'Log out' button.

## Justification

The script's modular design ensures that each function is responsible for a specific task, enhancing maintainability and facilitating error isolation. Comprehensive error logging is implemented to ensure that any errors encountered during execution are captured and logged for debugging and monitoring purposes. The use of environment variables ensures secure management of sensitive data such as URLs and credentials.
